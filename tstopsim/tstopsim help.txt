File setup:

b - nondrivable, think buildings
i - intersection
f* - straight piece, ex: fn gives a straight piece going north, which happens to be identical to fs,
t* - turn piece, tn gives north>east, te gives east>south, ts gives south>west, tw gives west>north
h* - gives a three way piece, where direction refers to the direction of the third road, so hs gives a T shape

* - refers to a cardinal direction

Spaces are ignored, invalid characters are treated as nondrivable roadtiles
It is recommended to surround your map with nondrivable roadtiles so it looks neaters, but not needed
Minimum map size is 3x3
