File setup:
Files end in either .txt or .traffic
The data is the same with either, its all just plain text

Data entry:
b - Nondrivable tile. Same color as the sidewalk, used for filler space and borders
i - Four way intersection with street lights
f* - Straight road piece. n and s give vertical road, e and w give a horizontal road
t* - Turn piece, 
    tn gives north to east, 
    te gives east to south, 
    ts gives south to west, 
    tw gives west to north
h* - Hives a three way piece, where direction refers to the direction of the third road, so hs gives a T shape

adding a y at the end of a turn tile or straight tile will remove the sidewalks
ie: fey will give an eastern facing straight tile without sidewalks

* - refers to a cardinal direction, use lowercase single characters
    n = North, s = South, e = East, w = West

Notes:
Spaces are ignored, invalid characters are treated as nondrivable roadtiles
It is recommended to surround your map with nondrivable roadtiles so it looks neater, but not needed
Minimum map size is 3x3

Extra Tiles:
m - "M.C. Donalds" - functions like a nondrivable tile
p* - Parking lot tile - also nondrivable, direction indicates where the end of the road spot faces (the direction you would drive into it at)

Decorative tiles:
A bit more complicated as this is a 3-4 characters long
    Format is d***, or for center pieces d**

Breakdown:
First character - identifier
d - identifies that this is a decorative tile
Second character - type
q - and edge piece, as in a side walk on one side
    Respective fourth characters:
        n - sidewalk on the north
        s - sidewalk on the south
        e - sidewalk on the east
        w - sidewalk on the west
c - center piece, requires no direction for a fourth character
v - corner piece, like turn pieces but without the stub
    Directions are identical to turn road tiles
    Respective fourth characters:
        n - west/southern sidewalks
        e - north/western sidewalks
        s - north/eastern sidewalks
        w - east/southern sidewalks
Third character - color type
    g - grass/green background
    a - water/blue background
Fourth character
    direction for the tile goes here, unless its a center piece then just dont put anything

examples:
dqgn - gives a decorative edge tile thats made of grass with a northern sidewalk
dca - gives a center piece made of water
dvwa - gives a decorative corner tiles made of water with sidewalks on the south and east sides
